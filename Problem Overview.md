#Descriptive Statistics:
1.1. Provide descriptive statistics for the study population. Present a table containing mean values, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for age, maximum heart rate (maxHR), ST depression, ST/HR index, and Î”RWA distributions among patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, include the distribution of sex, the number of cases with myocardial infarctions, and the prevalence of different medications in both groups.
1.2. Prior to conducting parametric tests to assess the statistical differences between two distributions, it is essential to evaluate the non-normality of both distributions. Evaluate the non-normality of maxHR: a) among patients without CAD, and b) among patients with CAD. Determine the risk level associated with incorrectly classifying the distribution of maxHR as non-normal.
