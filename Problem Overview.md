# 1. Descriptive Statistics:

**1.1** Provide descriptive statistics for the study population. Present a table containing mean values, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for age, maximum heart rate (maxHR), ST depression, ST/HR index, and ΔRWA distributions among patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, include the distribution of sex, the number of cases with myocardial infarctions, and the prevalence of different medications in both groups.

**1.2** Prior to conducting parametric tests to assess the statistical differences between two distributions, it is essential to evaluate the non-normality of both distributions. Evaluate the non-normality of maxHR: a) among patients without CAD, and b) among patients with CAD. Determine the risk level associated with incorrectly classifying the distribution of maxHR as non-normal.


# 2. Comparing the distributions of two groups:
**2.1** Assess the statistical disparity between patients with CAD and those without CAD concerning the distributions of ST depression, ST/HR index, ΔRWA, and maxHR.

**2.2** Evaluate the statistical distinction between patients with CAD and those without CAD in terms of: a) age and b) sex distributions. c) Determine the probability of making an erroneous conclusion that Finnish exercise-tested patients with CAD are older than those without CAD.

**2.3** Investigate: a) Whether the age distributions of women and men with CAD differ significantly. b) Examine the distributions of maxHR in women and men with CAD for statistical differences.


# 3. Correlation and regression between two variables

**3.1** Investigate whether there is a statistically significant linear correlation between ST depression, ST/HR index, and ΔRWA in both a) patients with CAD and b) patients without CAD.

**3.2** In clinical practice, the predicted maximum heart rate = 205 - 0.5 x age (or =220-age). This is used as a target heart rate when performing clinical exercise test. Give the equation and significance level for linear regression between maxHR and age a) in patient without CAD b) in patients with CAD. Presents also the plots

**3.3** Conduct regression analysis to explore the relationship between maxHR and ST depression, as well as between maxHR and ST/HR index.

**3.4** The age and ΔRWA do not correlate significantly in patients with CAD and without CAD when tested separately. Test the situation in total population. Give reasons for your finding.
