# 1. Descriptive Statistics:

**1.1** Provide descriptive statistics for the study population. Present a table containing mean values, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals for age, maximum heart rate (maxHR), ST depression, ST/HR index, and ΔRWA distributions among patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, include the distribution of sex, the number of cases with myocardial infarctions, and the prevalence of different medications in both groups.

**1.2** Prior to conducting parametric tests to assess the statistical differences between two distributions, it is essential to evaluate the non-normality of both distributions. Evaluate the non-normality of maxHR: a) among patients without CAD, and b) among patients with CAD. Determine the risk level associated with incorrectly classifying the distribution of maxHR as non-normal.


# 2. Comparing the distributions of two groups:
**2.1** Assess the statistical disparity between patients with CAD and those without CAD concerning the distributions of ST depression, ST/HR index, ΔRWA, and maxHR.

**2.2** Evaluate the statistical distinction between patients with CAD and those without CAD in terms of: a) age and b) sex distributions. c) Determine the probability of making an erroneous conclusion that Finnish exercise-tested patients with CAD are older than those without CAD.

**2.3** Investigate: a) Whether the age distributions of women and men with CAD differ significantly. b) Examine the distributions of maxHR in women and men with CAD for statistical differences.


# 3. Correlation and regression between two variables

**3.1** Investigate whether there is a statistically significant linear correlation between ST depression, ST/HR index, and ΔRWA in both patients with CAD and those without CAD.

**3.2** Determine the equation and significance level for the linear regression between maximum heart rate (maxHR) and age in patients with and without CAD. Utilize the formula for predicted maximum heart rate (205 - 0.5 x age or 220 - age) commonly used in clinical practice. Provide plots illustrating the relationship.

**3.3** Conduct regression analysis to explore the relationship between maxHR and ST depression, as well as between maxHR and ST/HR index.

**3.4** Assess whether age and ΔRWA exhibit significant correlation when analyzed together in the total population, considering patients with and without CAD. Offer explanations for any observed differences from separate analyses.
