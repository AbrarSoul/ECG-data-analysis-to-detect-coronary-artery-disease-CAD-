# Introduction
The project aims to analyze exercise ECG data to detect coronary artery disease (CAD). It includes variables such as cardiac medication, medical history, and hemodynamic response. Three univariate diagnostic classifiers were calculated based on literature-reported indicators of CAD to extract optimal information from the exercise ECG for diagnostic purposes.
