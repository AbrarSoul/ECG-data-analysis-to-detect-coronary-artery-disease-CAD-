A study conducted at Tampere University Hospital in Finland in 1990-1991 involved 1507 patients who underwent exercise ECG testing. Patients with left or right bundle branch block patterns on resting ECG were excluded. Among the remaining patients, 180 underwent coronary angiography within 180 days of the exercise test, of which 162 had significant coronary artery stenosis. From these, 100 were randomly selected for the study. Additionally, 221 patients with low prevalence of heart disease were included as a reference group.

The study focused on three diagnostic classifiers: ST-segment depression (ST-DEP), ST/HR index, and ΔR wave amplitude (ΔRWA). ST-segment depression was measured 60 ms after QRS-offset using the Mason-Likar modification of the 12-lead system. ST/HR index was calculated as ΔST divided by ΔHR during exercise. ΔRWA was defined as the difference in R wave amplitude between the start and peak of exercise. These classifiers were used to assess coronary artery disease based on exercise ECG data.
